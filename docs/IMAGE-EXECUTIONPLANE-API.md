Execution logging methods used in the image and controlplane API method implementation.

__`executionplane`__  [method] [arguments]  
Takes as arguments a method + arguments for execution.  
It pipes the output of `stdout` and `stderr` as an `executionplane-message` of type INFO or ERROR respectively.

__`executionplane-complete`__  
Executes `executionplane-message` with type _COMPLETED_.

__`executionplane-copied`__  [source >> destination]

__`executionplane-info`__  [information]  
Executes `executionplane-message` with type _INFO_ and includes information if supplied.

__`executionplane-invoke`__  [method] [arguments]  
Invokes a method with arguments.
It is used for methods that implement the executionplane API internally.
It doesn not allow recursive method calls.

__`executionplane-message`__  [type][message details]
Emits a message of [type] with [message details] if supplied.

__`executionplane-stderr`__  [INPUT]  
Reads the input buffer and outputs it as `executionplane-message`s of type _ERROR_.
Auxiliary method used by `executionplan`.

__`executionplane-stdout`__  [INPUT]  
Reads the input buffer and outputs it as `executionplane-message`s of type _INFO_.
Auxiliary method used by `executionplan`.

__`executionplane-transparent`__  [method] [arguments]
